Attempt to update Devore's CauseWay DOS extender for modern build systems.

The source code for CauseWay v3.60 was originally found under the [Open Watcom source tree](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2).  In addition:
 * `watcom/mkcode.c` came from `bld/watcom/c/mkcode.c` in the same Watcom tree.

Andrew Jones also hosts a copy of (a slightly older) [CauseWay v3.52](https://github.com/amindlost/cw).
